 This site provides an ontological framework for “Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action Pharmacodynamics Ontology” and a part of the “Expanded Anatomical Ontology” related to dysuria that is in development, as supplementary information for the article “Auto-generated Physiological Chain Data for an Ontological Framework for Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action to Determine Suspected Drugs in Cases of Dysuria”.

 These ontologies share the same top-level ontology as YAMATO. These ontologies are compatible with ontology families of the Japan Clinical Ontology in Anatomical Structure and Disease States  (CONAND) that are built by the ontology editor HOZO.

 YAMATO is available at the following web site.
