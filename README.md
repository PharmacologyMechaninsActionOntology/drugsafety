  This site provides an ontological framework for “Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action Pharmacodynamics Ontology” and a part of the “Expanded Anatomical Ontology” related to dysuria that is in development, as supplementary information for the article “Auto-generated Physiological Chain Data for an Ontological Framework for Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action to Determine Suspected Drugs in Cases of Dysuria”.

 These ontologies share the same top-level ontology as YAMATO. These ontologies are compatible with ontology families of the Japan Clinical Ontology in Anatomical Structure and Disease States  (CONAND) that are built by the ontology editor HOZO.

 YAMATO is available at the following web site. 
	http://download.hozo.jp/onto_library/upperOnto.htm
 HOZO is also available at the following web site.

File list:

1. An ontological framework for “Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action Pharmacodynamics Ontology”
-XML format (by HOZO)
-RDF format
-OWL (simple) format
-OWL (detailed) format
2. A part of the “Expanded Anatomical Ontology” related to dysuria
-XML format (by HOZO)
-RDF format
-OWL (simple) format
-OWL (detailed) format

*RDF and OWL files were produced from the original HOZO XML format files
by using the export function in HOZO-Ontology Editor.
Please note that RDF and OWL (simple) format represent only main
concepts (classes) and relationships in original Hozo format because
some differences of ontology representation model. OWL (detailed) format
represents all information in Hozo format based-on the role
representation model [8] while some model is improved using OWL2 from
previous one [9].
